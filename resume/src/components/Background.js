          <h3>Hello! My name is William Park and I enjoy coding and learning more aobut coding.
            I was always curious about how internet and website works.
            I decided to learn more about coding by taking courses at Community College,
            but since I'm head of household, so I couldnt stop working.
            Later on I found about I can self-taught and taking coding bootcamp.
            I took part time Coding Bootcamp call Coding Dojo in June, 2021, but I wasnt really successful with it.
            Lecture time was during my working hours so I couldn't attend any of the lectures.
            Since I couldn't take any lectures I was behind on learning and my skills couldn't improve.
            Fast-forward to today, I am spending more time to learn more to improve my skills.
            My end goal is to career change and work as a Software Engineer.
